## Set up

For development, we're using Bulma, and to take advantage of its customize-ability,
we're using the `bulma` package and `sass`. To set it up, install the dependencies:

```
cd client
npm install
```

Once you've installed the dependencies, start up sass:

```
npm run sass
```

Now, anytime you save a sass file in the `sass` directory, it will be compiled to
a CSS file with the same name inside the `css` directory.
